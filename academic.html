		<h1>My Academic Journey</h1>
		<h2>Primary School</h2>
		<p>I attended Valley View Academy from 2007-2016, where I learned the basics of reading, writing, and mathematics. I have many fond memories of my time there, including a school trip to Masai Mara where I saw a lion for the first time in my life.</p>
		<h2>Secondary School</h2>
		<p>From 2017-2021, I attended Chianda High School, where I studied a variety of subjects, including physics, biology, and chemistry. I was also involved in extracurricular activities such as the 100 meters race, long jump, and basketball. One of my proudest accomplishments from secondary school was winning a medal in the 100 meters race.</p>
		<h2>University</h2>
		<p>Currently, I am a student at Kenyatta University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. During my first year at the university, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Canada and also participated in various extracurricular activities. One of the most memorable experiences at the university was boarding a plane to Canada for the first time. I am grateful for the education and experience I gained there.</p>
		<p>Overall, education has played an important role in shaping who I am today, and I am proud of the hard work and dedication I have put into my studies.</p>
